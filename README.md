# YoutubePersistency
A handy chrome extension that allows the player to be sticky between views,
just like it is on smartphone/tablet.

## How to use
When viewing a video, a small icon appears on the top left corner of the player
When clicked, it makes the player shrink, and move to the bottom right corner of the page, where
it will stay, no matter where you navigate on the website (search, homepage, etc.)

## TODO
- Make the iframe (mini-player) implements only the player (currently copies the whole page)
- Make the trigger stop the original player (currently both run simultaneously)
- Make the mini-player "smarter" when switching content (currently allows 2 videos playing simultaneously)
